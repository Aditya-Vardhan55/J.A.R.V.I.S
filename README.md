## Overview
JARVIS is an intelligent personal AI assistant designed to simplify tasks, automate routines, and provide conversational support using cutting-edge language models. Inspired by Iron Man's assistant, this project blends multiple AI technologies to create a customizable, context-aware assistant tailored to individual users.
## Features 🚀
🧠 Conversational AI with personality modes

📚 Contextual Memory for better, long-term interactions

🌐 Multi-Model Routing (OpenAI, Cohere, HuggingFace, Groq)

🔄 Multi-threaded Request Handling for smooth operations

🗣️ Speech-to-Text & Text-to-Speech functionality

🗨️ Multilingual Support for global users

🪄 Wake Word Detection to trigger voice assistant

🧩 Modular Architecture for easy expansion

💾 Structured Memory Storage for dynamic learning
## Tech Stack 🛠️
_Python_ (core logic and backend)

_FastAPI / Flask_ (API framework)

_Langchain, Transformers, Groq SDK, Cohere, OpenAI API_ (AI/LLM integration)

_SpeechRecognition, pyttsx3 / Azure TTS_ (voice input/output)

_SQLite / JSON / Redis_ (for storing memory or logs)

_Frontend _(optional): _Streamlit / React_ (for interface)

## How It Works ⚙️
User Interaction: Input through text or voice.

Model Routing: Routes request to best-suited model (e.g., OpenAI, Cohere).

Processing: Handles logic, memory, personality settings.

Response Generation: Produces human-like responses with context.

Voice Output: Converts reply into speech using selected voice engine.

Logging & Memory Update: Saves new facts or conversations if configured.
